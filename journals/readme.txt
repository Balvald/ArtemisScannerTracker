You can put game journals here so that you can let the plugin scan through them with the

"Scan local journal folder for sold exobiology" - Button.

General idea is that you might want to put the stash of your whole journal limpet journals into this folder temporarily scan through locally and then get rid of the journals afterwards.

Needing only to scan the specified E:D journal file location for when the plugin was not used to fix recent blindspots in the biodata tracking.
