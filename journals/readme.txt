You can put game journals here so that you can let the plugin scan through them with the

"Scan local journal folder for sold exobiology" - Button.

General idea is that you might want to put the stash of your whole journal limpet journals into this folder temporarily scan through locally and then get rid of the journals afterwards.

If you want to keep your record straight check that the set of journals that you put into the folder does not leave a gap of information in between
(as in a journal file between that comes chronologically between two others is missing.) and goes up to the most recent journal entry.
