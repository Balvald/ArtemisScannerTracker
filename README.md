# ArtemisScannerTracker
 A EDMC plugin that keeps track of the Exobiology Scanner of a CMDRs Artemis suit in ED:Odyssey

## Installation

1. Find your EDMC _plugins_ folder (In EDMC settings under _plugins_ you can click the button _Open_ to open the _plugins_ folder)
2. Download the latest release.
3. Unpack the _.zip_ archive of the latest release and move the _ArtemisScannerTracker_ folder into said _plugins_ folder.

You will need to re-start EDMC if EDMC was open while you installed the plugin. Otherwise just start EDMC

## Usage

You have to do _nothing_ (yay) apart from having to play Elite Dangerous while using this plugin with EDMC.

The plugin keeps track of the Exobiology Scanner through a Cmdr's journal entries.
It tracks which species (Tussock, Fungoida, ...), and on which body the last exobiology scan occurred (Futes A 2, Moriosong A 1 a, ...) and also the state of the progress of the last exobiological scan. (1/3 found, 2/3 found...)

So you don't have to look at the Scanner LEDs in game after returning to a session and wonder "Which goddamn plant was I scanning again?" while being several thousand lightyears away from Sol.
Sadly that type of information is impossible to get from the Exobiology scanner itself. 
The only thing that it can tell us even despite not telling us _what_ or on which _body_ we last scanned is that the last scan is _incomplete_. The horror. Damn you Supratech! You damn Scoudrels!

Anyway with this plugin those kind of problems are hopefully becoming a thing of the past for our all most favourite recreational activity of scanning space grass while binging Star Trek TNG I guess.
